# 0G Grand Prix
0G Grand Prix is an open-source racing game in spaced built in the Godot game engine.
It is currently just a prototype, however most of the racing elements have already been implemented.

## Game Mechanics
#### 6-axis game play
You can move around and look in any direction you desire. Here are the controls, keyboard first/controller (recommended) second:
WASD/left stick - act as expected
Q or shift/left trigger - down
E or space/right trigger - up
mouse/right stick - look as normal, although it's all realative. You'll understand when you play
right click/right bumper - roll right
left click/left bumper - roll left
ctrl/X - stabalize
scroll up/press right stick - increase thrust
scroll down/press left stick - decrease thrust
#### Gravity wells
Apply gravitational forces to the player, allowing sling shoting around it or launching off of it.
Blue means positive gravity, pulling you in to it. 
Red means inverse gravity, pushing you away from it.
#### Gravity rings
Increase or decrease speed by a multiplier allowing you to slow down quickly for a tight corner or speed up quickly on a straight.
Blue means a multiplier greater than 1, increaseing your speed.
Red means a multiplier less than 1, reducing your speed.


## Upcoming features before Alpha Release
#### More music
One song will get quite repetative, I'll be adding at least 2 other songs to add some variaty.
#### More levels and level select menu
More variaty, at least 2 more levles, likely more. All (planned) gameplay mechanics are already implemented so feel free to open the project in Godot and build more levels! (note: as of now the player MUST start at 0, 0, 0)
#### Textures
Add some depth to the levels, make things more visually apealing.
